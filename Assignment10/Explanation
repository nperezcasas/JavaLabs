Assignment due 1 week from today:

P16.10
---
Add a method boolean contains(Object obj) that checks whether our LinkedList
implementation contains a given object. Implement this method by directly traversing
the links, not by using an iterator.

Use the equals method to determine whether obj equals node.data for a given node.
---

You must also create a testing program that demonstrates this all works.

For example: Create a linked list, add 5 elements.  Test with an element
that is in the list to see that it works. Test with an element that is not
in the list to see that you get the expected answer for that as well.

Extra Credit opportunity:

Maximum of 10 points....but you would have to really impress me to earn 10. A
complete program with a good demo would probably be worth around 7, you will need
to really show mastery to get the full 10.

Check out P16.15, P16.16, P16.17, and P16.18.

Do as many of these as you wish to earn a few points of extra credit.

Please turn in just one final program, not four separate ones.

Use String instead of the Object type in your code.

You must include a thorough demo program that demonstrates you *understand*
what you have created.

You'll need to follow all the basic guidelines like coding style, comments, etc.
that we have used all semester -- if you can't at least get to this level, you
will probably get zero points.
